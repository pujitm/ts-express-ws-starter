# ts-express-ws-starter

Starter project with Typescript, Express, and Websockets (express-ws), compatible with VSCode and Visual Studio.

See scripts in `package.json`. Allows for better Windows-Mac-Linux collaboration.

## Getting Started

1. Fork or clone

2. Change remote url --> https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url

3. `npm install --dev` or `npm install`. Make sure Typescript is installed globally. If it isn't, change `tsc` in the npm scripts to refer to a project-specific reference (likely in `./node_modules/.bin`).

4. Run your platform-specific variant of `npm run start`
